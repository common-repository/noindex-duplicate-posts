This plugin will automatically add a 'Noindex' meta tag to posts that are a duplicate determined by the slug and preexisting post names. 

== Description ==

To help your Wordpress installation be more optimized for search engines, this plugin will include a 'noindex' meta tag in the header of any duplicate posts.
Robots will not index any posts with matching title tags, which is a known indicator of negative SEO. This is very useful for automated posting and working with a large amount of posts.

== Installation ==


1. Upload `/noindex-duplicate-posts/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
